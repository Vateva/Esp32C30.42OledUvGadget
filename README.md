# Miniature UV Index Display

This device shows the **UV Index** using an **SH1106 0.42" OLED display** and an **LTR390 UV sensor**. The display alternates every 2 seconds between the numeric UV index and a corresponding icon. Most of the work went into making the device as compact as possible, along with designing the casing and the switch mechanism using Blender.

## Features

- **Auto On/Off**: Opening the protective cover turns the device on and takes a single reading, closing it powers it off to conserve battery.
- **UV Index Reading**: Uses the **LTR390** sensor to read UV levels.
- **Icon Display**: Alternates between text and icons based on UV level:
  - üåô Low or no UV
  - üòä Safe UV
  - üï∂Ô∏è Moderate UV
  - üî• High UV
  - üòà Very High UV
  - üíÄ Extreme UV

## Device Design

### Wiring & Assembly

The main design goal was to make the device as compact as possible with the available components.

- **Battery** was wired and glued to the **TP4057** charging board. The **charging board** was then connected to the **ESP32-C3**.

- The **LTR390** sensor was added last, creating a "component sandwich". Internal layers (left to right): ESP32-C3 (with OLED), LiPo, TP4057, LTR390

- Fully wired setup including the switch

### Casing

The most time-consuming part was designing the **protective casing and toggle mechanism** in Blender.  
- The STL file is included in the repo.
- Blender source files will also be uploaded for modifications.

The **bottom casing** is a simple **rectangular prism**:
- Cutouts for the **OLED** and **USB-C charging port**.
- The ESP32-C3‚Äôs USB-C port is **not exposed** to avoid user confusion even if firmware updates require disassembly.

The **top casing** has:
- A small mechanism that **Reveals or hides** the UV sensor and **Toggles the switch** to power the device on or off.
